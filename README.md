# Time Series Forecasting Project

This repository contains a Python project used in a presentation to demonstrate time series forecasting techniques. The goal is to provide a clear and simple example to help users understand how to forecast data trends over time using Python.

## Features
- Implements time series forecasting using common Python libraries.
- Includes an interactive Jupyter Notebook for demonstration purposes.
- Designed for easy setup and use.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment management tool (e.g., `venv`)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:denissonleal/timeseries-forecast-latinoware-2024.git
cd timeseries-forecast-latinoware-2024
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
```bash
# On Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Jupyter Notebook
Run the Jupyter Notebook to interact with the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file `latinoware.ipynb` in your browser to start exploring.

---

## Example Usage
The notebook includes the following:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Visualizing time series data.
3. Building and evaluating a forecasting model.
4. Generating future predictions.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to replicate the forecasting process.

## Notes
- This project is intended for educational purposes.
- Ensure you have the required dataset or download it as described in the notebook.
- You can customize the model and parameters to experiment with different results.
